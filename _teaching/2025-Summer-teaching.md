This is an online and asynchronous course. Game theory is the study of strategic interaction between several decision-makers. We study the main equilibrium concepts for non-cooperative games in both static and dynamic settings with complete information: iterated strict dominance, rationalizability, Nash equilibrium, backward induction, and subgame perfection. We discuss applications to repeated games and multi-stage games drawing examples from politics, market competition, advertising, finance, labor markets, parlor games, and sports. <br>
*Prerequisites:  MAT 126 or 131 or 141 or AMS 151; C or higher in ECO 303*
