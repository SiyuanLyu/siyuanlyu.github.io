This paper shows that local officials’ personal preferences formed through early-life
experience affects Chinese housing sector development. We exploit a county-level
panel between 2000 and 2007 and use the Great Famine in China as a natural
experiment. Our specification shows that local officials’ early-life exposure to more
severe famine leads to significantly less development in the housing sector in their
jurisdictions, which remain robust to alternative specifications, placebo tests, and
competing hypotheses. Furthermore, we show that the early-life famine experience of
local officials is negatively correlated with statistical data manipulation, indicating
changing risk attitudes due to early-life famine experiences.
